Just playing around with ways to test rest apis using Rspec using the rest-client gem, json_expressions to match json more easily, and Rspec.

Testing was done against http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com, a fake online REST api for testing and prototyping.

To use, clone repo, run bundle.  Execute the spec folder using command `rspec spec`
